Hello, colleagues from Coursera. In this section, I will describe the data that we will be using
to solve Jonas' problem. Basically, we will be using two sources of data:

1. The first one, will give us the geospatial data needed to run our model (to plot in Folium, to
pass it to Foursquare). This is, in its very own essence, three things: the name of the 
neighborhood and its latitude and longitude. We will get this from the following website:

https://usc.data.socrata.com/dataset/Los-Angeles-Neighborhood-Map/r8qd-yxsr

There, we will download a csv file with the data of each neighborhood (name, latitude, longitude), that
we will upload into our notebook. Of course, we can use a lot of formats GeoJSON, Shapefile, etc. However,
for sake of simplicity, I will keep the basic and trusted csv format.


2. The second one, will give us the information of all the venues in each neighborhood, that will allow
us to select the neighborhood that maximize the benefits for Jonas. We will get this data from 
Foursquare, via API calls.
