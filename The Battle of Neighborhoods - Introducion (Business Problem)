Hello, colleagues from Coursera. This is the first part of the final capstone project. 
In this part, I will define the business problem to solve, as an introduction for our report.

Jonas is a student from Germany, who is looking to set up after a long time of traveling in USA.
He has been searching in internet, and he has decided for Los Angeles, California. However, he has
no idea of what neighborhood he must choose (which one will be the best for him). In order to solve this,
he has come up to our "Foreign Students Agency" to give him a solution to this problem. He is a very
active student, who needs to get plenty of social life in LA (he doesn't knows anyone there). So, for this,
he will pay for our services in "FSA". He will pay to us to give him an answer: from all the possible
neighborhoods, we must pick for him the one that will maximize his benefits (i.e., the one that has more
places to visit, to create social life, etc.).

He needs a report that compares the possible neighborhoods (we will only suggest him the best one, based in
our algorithm; however, he will decide at the end, with the report that we will deliver to him).
